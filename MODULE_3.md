# Module 3 - Crypto Essentials: Elliptic Curves and More

Welcome to Module 3. First, we will explore the key concepts behind elliptic curves and their importance in modern cryptography. Then we will take you deeper into more advanced topics like bilinear maps, pairing-based cryptography, and KZG polynomial commitments, multi-party computation.

## Intro to Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic curve cryptography builds upon traditional cryptographic principles by applying them to the mathematical structure of elliptic curves.

For example, there exists an **Elliptic Curve Discrete Log Problem (ECDLP)**. By using elliptic curves, it has certain benefits over the regular Discrete Log Problem (DLP). These links are a good place to start:

- [A (relatively easy to understand) primer on elliptic curve cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/)

**Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)** extends the traditional Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) by incorporating elliptic curves as well, enabling stronger security with shorter key lengths. This makes the algorithm more efficient and suitable for constrained environments. ECDSA is widely used in various secure communication protocols, including SSL/TLS.

The following StackExchange answer goes over the differences between some of the most popular digital signature protocols. It also leads into our next topic, which is another type of digital signature called the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).

## Schnorr Signatures and EdDSA (Optional)

EdDSA modifies and extends the Schnorr signature scheme to provide additional benefits. So it is crucial to first get an understanding of Schnorr signatures.

### EC-Schnorr Signatures

Schnorr signatures can also be extended to elliptic curves. A key benefit is their linear structure, which allows for multi-signature aggregation.

- [Introduction to Schnorr Signatures (more technical)](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/introduction-schnorr-signatures)

Let's dive into EdDSA and see how it builds on concepts found in Schnorr Signatures.

### Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)

Unlike Schnorr signatures, which may use a random value for generating the signature, EdDSA takes a deterministic approach. It hashes the private key and the message together to produce the randomness, ensuring repeatability.


Suppose we have a private key `k` and a message `m`. In EdDSA, we would compute:
- `r = HASH(k || m)`
- `R = r * G`
where `G` is the base point on the curve and `R` is another point on the curve.

Just like Schnorr, the signature in EdDSA is a pair `(R, s)`, where:
- `s = (r + HASH(R || A || m) * k) mod q`

The verification checks:
- `s * G = R + HASH(R || A || m) * A`

With the values `A` (public key), `m` (message), and the signature values `R` and `s`, verification would involve checking that the left-hand and right-hand sides of the above equation match.

## Pairing-Based Cryptography (PBC)

Many of the following topics will depend upon what is called pairing-based cryptography. 
You can imagine pairing is the multiplication of elliptic curve. The original elliptic curve is additive homomorphic but not multiplicative homomorphic. Pairing is a way to mimic it.

This is largely used in zk, especially during verification stage.

## BLS Signatures 

BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signatures are a type of cryptographic signature scheme that allows for efficient aggregation of individual signatures into a single signature. It also makes use of pairing-based cryptography.

The intuition of BLS is that it is an aggregation signature. The image below shows the public key and signature are aggregated. The advantage is all the signature can be verified at once. That's why it is used in consensus protocol.

## KZG Polynomial Commitments

Polynomial Commitments are cryptographic tools that allow the hiding of some coefficients while revealing others. They're used in various cryptographic proofs and blockchain protocols. For a better understanding of Polynomial Commitments
The intuition of KZG is that it is a commitment scheme. It is used to commit to a polynomial and later reveal a certain point on that polynomial. All your input data "lock" a specific polynomial.

KZG Polynomial Commitments is another technology that relies on pairing-based cryptography. The protocol is built upon pairing-friendly elliptic curves and bilinear properties. With this protocol, both the proof and commitment size is constant, no matter the degree of the polynomial being used.

Scroll's zk-rollup implementation makes use of this commitment scheme to commit to computations executed on an L2. While Ethereumâ€™s Proto-Danksharding proposal ([EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com)) uses it to commit to data blobs.

## Trusted Setup

The concept of a trusted setup is an important part of the KZG Polynomial commitment scheme, and indeed part of the wider culture of Ethereum. Here are a few resources to learn more about trusted setups.

The intuition of trusted setup is that it is a process to generate a bunch of point on the elliptic curve, the prover will input these points to the polynomial commitment. Therefore the output is a point on the curve as well. Especially the generation of these points requires many people join and discard the secret value. That's why it is called trusted.

### Multi-Party Computation (MPC) [Optional]

[Secure Multi-Party Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) or MPC for short, is a protocol that allows multiple entities to jointly compute a function without revealing their individual inputs.

The classic example of MPC is the [Yao's Millionaire Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem). This is a thought experiment in which two millionaires are interested in knowing which of them is richer without revealing their actual wealth.

MPC can be used to generate the secret value and the SRS for a trusted setup in a distributed manner, where multiple parties collaborate to generate the parameters without any single party having access to the entire secret value.
