# Module 1 - Intro to ZK

Welcome aboard! You've just embarked on an incredible journey into the realm of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). This fascinating aspect of cryptography provides the backbone for various privacy-preserving technologies. Notably, it's used in Ethereum, one of the most well-known blockchain platforms.

In this module, our primary goal is to introduce you to key concepts of ZKPs, such as soundness, completeness, and zero-knowledge itself. Additionally, we aim to cultivate your understanding of basic modular arithmetic through hands-on examples and exercises, which will prove vital for the subsequent modules.

Let‚Äôs get started!

## Tips to Learn Zero Knowledge

One really useful mental model to learn zero knowledge is to blackbox the concepts so that you don't get intimidated by the complexity of the topic. This doesn't mean you ignore the details, but rather, you focus on understanding the high-level concepts first and then dive into the details.

When you study the topic, read only required reading the first time. Skip the optional reading unless you are really curious of the details. This will help you to understand the topic without getting overwhelmed by the details.

## A Primer for Zero Knowledge Proofs

Before we delve into the core content of the module, consider acquainting yourself with some high-level concepts of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The following introductory articles will help you build a robust foundational understanding:

- [Zero-knowledge proofs | ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/)
- [A Primer on Zero-Knowledge Proofs üîè](https://medium.com/hackernoon/a-primer-on-zero-knowledge-proofs-892e6e277142)
- [Zero Knowledge Proofs: An illustrated primer [Part 1]](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/)
- [Zero Knowledge Proofs: An illustrated primer [Part 2]](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2017/01/21/zero-knowledge-proofs-an-illustrated-primer-part-2/)

You **DO NOT** have to read all of these articles, they are simply a starting point. However, throughout this course, we will provide you with a set of reflection questions to check your understanding.

## Thought Experiments

Engaging with these thought experiments will make abstract concepts more tangible and facilitate a deeper understanding of ZKPs. Each of these examples offers a unique perspective on the concept of zero-knowledge proofs:

# üí™ Exercises

Here are the exercises for this module. Collaborate with your team to find the answers, and remember to support each other!

## Comprehension

Summarize each of the following concepts in a few sentences:

1. Three-Colouring Graph problem with Hats
2.  Ali Baba‚Äôs Cave analogy
3.   The difference between interactive and non-interactive proofs

## Modular Arithmetic

Solve the following problems and gain a practical understanding of modular arithmetic:

1. $7\ mod\ 13$
2. $15\ mod\ 13$
3. $(7+15)\ mod\ 13$
4. $(7\ mod\ 13 + 15\ mod\ 13)\ mod\ 13$

If the results of the third and fourth calculations match, they follow a "group structure". Can you determine if these do?

## Generators

Consider the cyclic group $(Z_{12}, +\ mod\ 12)$, commonly referred to as the "additive group of integers modulo 12". Address the following points:

1. What does the term 'generator' mean?
2. Can you find a generator for this group?
3. Are there other generators for this group? If yes, what are they?

## Implementing a Modular Arithmetic Calculator

Your task is to implement a simple modular arithmetic calculator in JavaScript. The calculator should support three operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 

The function `modularCalculator` should take four parameters:
- A string, `op`, indicating the operation. It will be one of '+', '-', or '*'.
- Two integers, `num1` and `num2`, which are the operands for the operation.
- An integer, `mod`, which is the modulus.

The function should return the result of performing the indicated operation on `num1` and `num2`, then taking the result modulo `mod`. 

Remember, the result of subtraction could be negative, and in this case, you should add `mod` to the result to ensure it's positive. 

For addition and multiplication, remember that JavaScript's % operator gives the remainder, not the modulus, but these will be the same for positive numbers.

**Code Template:**

```javascript
function modularCalculator(op, num1, num2, mod) {
    // Your code here
}

modularCalculator('+', 10, 15, 12); // Should return: 1
modularCalculator('-', 10, 15, 12); // Should return: 7
modularCalculator('*', 10, 15, 12); // Should return: 6
```

Feel free to use `console.log` statements in your code to verify that your function is working as expected. For convenience, consider using https://repljs.com/ and pasting in the above code snippet to get started.
