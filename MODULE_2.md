## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption

Encryption is a technique used to encode data, making it readable only to those who possess the correct decryption key. There are two main types of encryption - symmetric and asymmetric, each serving different purposes and with their own strengths and weaknesses.

**Symmetric Encryption** - Also known as single-key encryption, this method involves using the same key for both encryption and decryption. The most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

**Asymmetric Encryption** - Also known as public-key encryption, this method uses a pair of keys: one for encryption and another for decryption. The RSA algorithm is one of the best known public-key algorithms.

The key difference between the two is the number of keys used: symmetric encryption uses one key for both encrypting and decrypting, while asymmetric encryption uses a different key for each (one public, one private).

## DLP-based Public-Key Cryptography
While RSA encryption is based on the hardness of factoring problem, there is another public key cryptography system based on hardness of Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP).

1. **Discrete Log Problem (DLP):** This is a cornerstone problem in public-key cryptography and underlies many key exchange and encryption algorithms. Understanding DLP provides a foundation for the remaining topics.

2. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:** This is one of the earliest practical implementations of key exchange protocols based on the Discrete Log Problem. It's critical to understand how secure communication can be established over insecure channels.

    This protocol is significant as it enables secure communication over insecure channels by allowing two parties to generate a shared secret key, which can then be used for encryption and decryption of messages

## Hash Functions

A hash function takes an input and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. **SHA-256** and **Poseidon** are popular cryptographic hash functions in our context, with Poseidon specifically designed for arithmetic-friendly operations, benefiting certain applications in blockchains.

The primary characteristics of a good hash function are [preimage resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack), second preimage resistance, and [collision resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance), ensuring data security and integrity. In blockchain technology, hash functions create an unalterable, unique representation of each block's content, contributing to the immutability and transparency of the system.

## Cryptographic Commitments

Cryptographic commitments are essential in cryptography and blockchain technology as they allow for selective hiding and revealing of information. This feature ensures data privacy while still enabling verification processes.

It helps achieve secure and efficient verification of transactions in blockchain protocols. In such contexts, sensitive information, such as transaction details or user identities, is hidden while revealing others for the verifier to authenticate the transactions.

You can abstract the concept of commitment to commit and open (reveal). This makes it easier to understand the big picture without looking into details.

![commitment scheme](./assets/commitment.png)
[Source](https://zecrey.medium.com/commmitment-schemes-in-zecrey-e6c446e2da97)

For example, there are commit phase
and reveal phase. You encrypt secret and and reveal it later.

### Pedersen Commitments (Optional)
Pedersen Commitments are a type of cryptographic primitive that allows you to commit to a certain value while keeping it hidden, with the ability to disclose the committed value later. They're often used to achieve privacy-preserving properties in cryptographic protocols. For more on Pedersen Commitments, review these materials:

## Digital Signatures

Digital signatures ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital messages or documents. By providing a means to verify the origin and confirm that the content has not been altered, digital signatures play a pivotal role in maintaining trust in digital communications.

In PKC, anyone can encrypt their message with the receiver's public key, and only the receiver can decrypt the message with their private key. In digital signatures, on the other hand, if a signer generates a signature for a message using their private key, anyone can validate it using the signer's public key. Therefore, the message of the signature is made public, which distinguishes it from cryptographic commitments.

## Programming Challenges

In these challenges, you'll implement cryptographic methods in a Node.js environment. You will need the following packages, which you can install using NPM:

```bash
npm install merkletreejs poseidon-encryption ffjavascript
```

### Challenge 1: Asymmetric Encryption and Digital Signature

In this challenge, you will use the `crypto` built-in library in Node.js to implement asymmetric encryption. Your task is to encrypt and decrypt some sample text, generate a digital signature for the encrypted message, and then verify it. This simulates a secure message exchange where you want to ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of the messages.

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Asymmetric encryption
const { publicKey, privateKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('rsa', { modulusLength: 2048 });

// Encrypt
const plaintext = 'This is a secret message.';
// TODO: Use the publicKey to encrypt the plaintext message. Remember that RSA encryption is public key encryption.

// Decrypt
// TODO: Use the privateKey to decrypt the encrypted message. The result should be the original plaintext.

// Create a digital signature
const sign = crypto.createSign('SHA256');
sign.update(plaintext);
sign.end();
// TODO: Use the privateKey to sign the plaintext message. This will generate a digital signature.

// Verify a digital signature
const verify = crypto.createVerify('SHA256');
verify.update(plaintext);
verify.end();
// TODO: Use the publicKey to verify the signature. It should return true if the signature is valid.
```

Tip: The `crypto` library has specific functions for encryption, decryption, signing, and verifying. Look up the library documentation for examples and usage [here](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html).

### Challenge 2: Hashing with SHA-256 and Poseidon

For this challenge, your task is to compute the SHA-256 and Poseidon hashes of some input data. You will then observe how the hash value changes drastically even with a small change in the input data. This is an important property of cryptographic hash functions called ["avalanche effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect).

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");
const poseidon = require("poseidon-encryption");

// SHA-256
const data = "This is some data X.";
// TODO: Compute the SHA-256 hash of the data and print it. Try changing the data slightly and observe the changes in the hash.

// Poseidon
const inputs = [1, 2, 3, 4];
// TODO: Compute the Poseidon hash of the inputs and print it. Remember that Poseidon accepts an array of integers as input.
```

Tip: Use the `.digest('hex')` method of the `hash` object to print the hash in a human-readable format. As for the `poseidon-encryption` package, there lacks good documentation but have a look at the source code [here](https://github.com/weijiekoh/circomlib/tree/feat/poseidon-encryption) for some hints (pay special attention to the tests for example usage).

### Challenge 3: Using a Simple Merkle Tree

In this challenge, you will use the 'merkletreejs' library to construct a simple Merkle Tree from some input data. You will then generate a proof for a leaf node and verify it. This task is analogous to verifying a transaction in a block in a blockchain.

```javascript
const MerkleTree = require('merkletreejs');
const crypto = require('crypto');

function hashFunction(data) {
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
  hash.update(data);
  return hash.digest();
}

// Create tree
const leaves = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].map(x => hashFunction(x));
// TODO: Build the Merkle tree using the leaves and hashFunction. Compute the root of the tree and print it.

// Generate and verify proof
const leaf = hashFunction('b');
// TODO: Generate a proof for the leaf 'b' and verify it against the root of the tree. It should return true if the leaf is part of the tree.
```

Tip: Refer to the `merkletreejs` library [documentation](https://github.com/merkletreejs/merkletreejs) for the functions needed to build the tree, generate the proof, and verify it.

### Challenge 4: Implementing Pedersen Commitments

This challenge is a little more involved, but should be more rewarding. Here, you will be creating a Javascript object capable of Pedersen Commitments. This template should get you started:

```javascript
class PedersenCommitment {
  constructor() {
    // Set prime number (p) and generator (g)
    this.p = BigInt(23); // use a large prime in a real-world scenario
    this.g = BigInt(4); // use a large number in a real-world scenario
    this.h = null;
    this.r = null;
    this.s = null;
  }

  // Generate 'h' with a random number 'r' (h = g^r mod p)
  generateH() {
    // TODO: Generate a random number r (and save it to this.r)
    // TODO: Calculate h using g, r and p (and save it to this.h)
  }

  // Generate the commitment (g^s * h^r mod p)
  generateCommitment(s) {
    // TODO: Convert s to BigInt (and save it to this.s)
    // TODO: Calculate and return the commitment using g, s, h, r and p
  }

  // Reveal the secret number and random number (s, r)
  reveal() {
    // TODO: Return the secret and random number
  }

  // Verify the commitment (g^s * h^r mod p)
  verify(s, r, C) {
    // TODO: Verify the commitment by recalculating it and comparing with C
  }
}

// Test the PedersenCommitment
const pc = new PedersenCommitment();
pc.generateH();

// Party A: Generate a commitment
let secretNumber = 7;
let commitment = pc.generateCommitment(secretNumber);
console.log("Commitment: ", commitment);

// Party A: Reveal the secret and random number
let reveal = pc.reveal();
console.log("Revealed: ", reveal);

// Party B: Verify the commitment
let verification = pc.verify(reveal.s, reveal.r, commitment);
console.log("Verification: ", verification);
```

If everything worked properly, the final output should read:

```
Verification:  true
```

Congrats on reaching the end of this module!
